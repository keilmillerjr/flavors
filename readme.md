## DESCRIPTION:

flavors is a simple layout for the [AttractMode](http://attractmode.org) front end. It has 12 different user selectable "flavors". It works well with any orientation and resolution qvga (240p) and upwards. Make sure the crt shader is not enabled if you are using it on a crt monitor.

## Requirements:

* AttractMode compatible device
* Mame/GroovyMame installed with corresponding roms

## Paths

You may need to change file paths as necessary as each platform (windows, mac, linux) has a slightly different directory structure.

## Install Files

1. Copy layout files to ```$HOME/.attract/layouts/flavors/```

## Credit

Inspiration for this theme came from the [unnamed theme](http://forum.attractmode.org/index.php?topic=1231.0) by [liquid8d](http://forum.attractmode.org/index.php?action=profile;u=4)
